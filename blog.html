    <p><b>The e-Book culture came into existence in late 2000s and became popular
        after the arrival of some e-Book providers like Amazon Kindle, etc.
        However it is not widely recognized because of its cost. So many people
        preferred libraries for its low cost and reliance. Some people even preferred free
        copies of books that is available in internet. But nowadays e-Books became a
        trend after the COVID-19 lockdown. Many people preferred reading online
        books over reading library books. After the arrival of online classes, the need
        for books became enormous and most of the students canâ€™t afford to buy or
        rent them. Also if we search for one particular book in interne, there will be
        multiple copies and most of them are preview of the books that have only 10-15
        pages. This thing will confuse the students. By taking this problem, our team
        decided to do a project based on the concept of e-Library. Our core concept is
        to make things easier for the students, who are in need of the books. We
        will collect best copies of the books available in the internet and group them
        into several categories such as Engineering, Medical, Arts and Science, etc.
        Students can easily navigate through our website and can download whatever
        the books they need. Also it is cost-free so that any student can use and
        download whatever they need. Also we will update top five downloads weekly,
        so that students can know which topic is currently on trend.
